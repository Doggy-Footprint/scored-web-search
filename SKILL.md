description: Filter and rank web sources with heuristic scoring system before the main agent reads them. By using only select sources, this skill reduces context rot, improves the quality of research reports, and also reduces token usage. This skill provides academic, non-academic, community-opinion, news, and official-document modes. Triggering expressions are "scored web search", "search", "research", "investigate", "find", "look up", "back it up", "evidence", "fact check", and similar. This skill intentionally drops some of web-search results - if you need those for example, searching for more possible options, please use regular web search instead.

# Scored Web Search

This skill filters sub-standard sources before the main agent reads them when high quality research is on demand. 

## Pipeline

```
1. Search   (lightweight subagent) → URL list only, no summaries
2. Score    (srcscore.py)          → 0-100 + verdict
3. Read     (main agent)           → top n PRIMARY/SUPPORT only
4. Re-search (loop back to 1 if sources are thin)
5. Verify   (optional)             → claims vs. evidence
6. Write    → every claim tagged with source + score
```

When sub-agents are not available, the main agent does Steps 1 and 5 as fallback.

### Step 1 — Search: collect URLs only

The main agent defines the search keywords. Delegate the actual web search to a **lightweight subagent** (do NOT use `fork` / make subagent to call web-search tools at a single turn. / use gpt-5.6-luna or haiku-4.5) and accept only a `URL | title` list in return. NO summaries, NO snippets, DO NOT open page — the point of this step is to keep low-quality text out of the main context.

Max 2 sub-topics per subagent. For 3 or more sub-topics, run subagents in parallel. Collect 40-60 URLs total.

No sub agent fallback: main agent calls the web-search tool itself. Extract only the URLs from the results and write them straight to `urls.txt`. The caution for sub agents works same for main agent too.

### Step 2 — Score: hand it to the script

Write all subagent returns to `urls.txt`(one URL per line) in temporal directory and run `scripts/srcscore.py`. You can check arguments with `--help`.

Output is a compact table, roughly 15 tokens per line:

```
SCORE VERDICT T  SIGNALS                     URL
 98.0 PRIMARY  3  cit=132.0k,y2017,published@NeurIPS  https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
 77.9 SUPPORT  3  cit=120,y2026,preprint      https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.xxxxx
 46.2 SKIM     4  ★84.5k                      https://github.com/foo/bar
 14.0 DROP     6                              https://www.w3schools.com/...
  0.0 BLOCKED  0  RETRACTED                   https://...
```

| Verdict | Score | What to do with it |
|---|---|---|
| PRIMARY | 78+ | Cite directly. Valid source for figures and claims |
| SUPPORT | 62-77 | Supporting evidence. Never the sole basis for a conclusion |
| SKIM | 46-61 | Cross-checking only. Cite only when another source says the same |
| WEAK | 30-45 | Background reading. **Do not cite** |
| DROP | <30 | Do not open |
| BLOCKED | 0 | Retracted paper / scraper. Never use |

### Step 3 — Read: open only what passed
`WebFetch` only the URLs this returns. **Do not open WEAK/DROP.** The moment you open one to judge it for yourself, the savings are gone — that is the exact problem this skill exists to solve.

Default cap: 8-12 sources. Up to 20 if the user asks for depth.

If pages you read names keywords to search, do not run the search yourself. Hand it to a new subagent like Step 1.

Two re-search rounds max. Beyond that, **ask the user explicitly** before searching again, and if they decline, state plainly in the answer that the evidence base is thin.


### Step 4 — Re-search: loop back to 1 when sources are thin

Do not promote sub-WEAK sources becase of low credible sources. Change the keywords and re-run from step 1.

### Step 5 — Verify (optional): claims vs. evidence

Only when the user has stressed accuracy, or the report carries a lot of figures. Give the sources url that passed scoring filter to a **lightweight subagent** and have it do **this and nothing else**:

> For each figure or claim: (a) does this document actually state that figure, (b) is this document the original source of the figure or is it citing someone else, (c) are sample size, time period, and measurement method stated. Answer only in the format `claim | supported/secondary/contradicted | location of evidence`.

When a figure turns out to be secondary, the document you read is not its source. Take the URL of the original it cites — a new source, not yet scored — and run that through step 2; if it passes, read it and attribute the figure to it. If the original is paywalled, dead, or fails step 2, keep the figure attributed to the document you read and mark it as a re-report — never present a re-report as a primary source.

No sub agent fallback: run the same claim-vs-evidence check yourself instead of delegating it. This step doesn't reintroduce the context-pollution problem Step 1 guards against — the sources are already open and being read — so there's no quality loss from doing it inline.

### Step 6 — Write

Tag every figure and claim with its source and score: `... rose 32% (Nature 2025, PRIMARY 91)`. Any sentence resting on a SKIM-or-below source gets a hedge — "not yet confirmed", "according to a single report".

Close the report with one line: `n sources collected → m passed → l read`.

## Scoring Policy

The domain tier sets the base score; secondary signals (citations, engagement, recency) adjust it.

| Tier | Base | Trust level |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 88 | The primary source itself |
| 2 | 74 | Original work from a vetted institution |
| 3 | 60 | Original work with no review process, or commentary on a primary source |
| 4 | 46 | Second-hand relay. Cross-checking only |
| 5 | 32 | No basis for trust (default for unregistered domains) |
| 6 | 14 | Low quality / spam |
| block | 0 | Always BLOCKED |

The same domain sits at different tiers in different modes, because a mode asks a different question. Read the actual placement off the score table.

## Modes

`--mode` sets the goal of the search.

| Mode | What changes |
|---|---|
| `academic` (default) | Base policy as-is |
| `non-academic` | GitHub / engineering blogs. Engagement (stars, HN) weighted higher |
| `community-opinion` | Discussion threads. Peer-review off, engagement weighted highest, short half-life, discussion hosts treated as primary sources |
| `news` | Reporting. Peer-review off, recency dominant, own tier ladder |
| `official-docs` | Product/framework docs. Recency, peer-review and engagement all off; official docs treated as primary sources |

## Error handling
If script fails, report it and stop; do not fall back to unscored reading.


## Don't Do This

- Don't cite WEAK/DROP material "for reference anyway."
- Don't pile search-result snippets into the main context — the subagent returns URLs only.
- Don't trust content just because its domain score is high. The tier is a device for choosing what to read, not a guarantee that the content is true.
- Don't doulbe-check socre.
